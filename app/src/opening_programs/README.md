# Opening programs documentation

This module contains the logic to open a program using RPA, the only file you should look for will be "open_program.py" the others are just complements of it.

You can use it by adding at the end of the "open_program.py" file the line 

```
open_program("")
```
This will prompt a text box to add the name of the program. Write the full name
```
open_program("(full name of a program)")
```
Or you can just call the function with the full name in init (without the parentesis).

You are getting some errors regarding identifiers you can check the [documentation here](./opening_programs/Identifiers%20documentation.pdf)
